            <p>The <strong>North Ronaldsay</strong> or <strong>Orkney</strong> is a breed of sheep from North Ronaldsay, the northernmost island of Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland. It belongs to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_European_short-tailed_sheep" target="_blank">Northern European short-tailed sheep</a> group of breeds, and has evolved without much cross-breeding with modern breeds. It is a smaller sheep than most, with the rams (males) horned and ewes (females) mostly hornless. It was formerly kept primarily for wool, but now the two largest flocks are feral, one on North Ronaldsay and another on the Orkney island of Linga Holm. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust lists the breed as "vulnerable", with fewer than 600 registered breeding females in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The semi-feral flock on North Ronaldsay is the original flock that evolved to subsist almost entirely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed">seaweed</a> â€“ they are one of few mammals to do this. They are confined to the shoreline by a 1.8 m (6 ft) tall drystane dyke, which completely encircles the island, forcing the sheep to evolve this unusual characteristic. The wall was built as kelping (the production of soda ash from seaweed) on the shore became uneconomical. Sheep were confined to the shore to protect the fields and crofts inside, and afterwards subsisted largely on seaweed.</p>
            
            <p>This diet has caused a variety of adaptations in the sheep's digestive system. These sheep have to extract the trace element copper far more efficiently than other breeds as their diet has a limited supply of copper. This results in them being susceptible to copper toxicity, if fed on a grass diet, as copper is toxic to sheep in high quantities. Grazing habits have also changed to suit the sheep's environment. To reduce the chance of being stranded by an incoming tide, they graze at low tide and then ruminate at high tide.</p>
            
            <p>A range of fleece colours are exhibited, including grey, brown and red. Meat from the North Ronaldsay has a distinctive flavour, described as "intense" and "gamey",[3] due, in part, to the high iodine content in their diet of seaweed. The meat is protected by the UK Government, so only meat from North Ronaldsay sheep can be marketed as Orkney Lamb.</p>
